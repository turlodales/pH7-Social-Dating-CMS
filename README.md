## üëÄ Software Overview üéâ

**pH7 Dating CMS** is a **scalable social community CMS** based on a powerful modular OOP and server-side rendering architecture, using the **MVC** architecture (Model-View-Controller).

It is designed with the **KISS** principle in mind, and the whole source code can be read and understood in minutes. For better flexibility, the software uses **PDO** (PHP Data Objects) abstraction which allows the choice of the database. The principle of development is **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) aimed at reducing repetition of information of all kinds (no duplicate code) and **YAGNI** principle to avoid unused code/not needed functionality in the software.

This Free and Open Source **Social Dating Site Builder** aims to be low resource-intensive, powerful, stable and secure.

Based on **[pH7Framework](https://github.com/pH7Software/pH7-Social-Dating-CMS/tree/18.x/_protected/framework#ph7framework)**, a framework written specifically for this project, the CMS also comes with 40 system modules ready to be used.

*To summarize, **pH7Builder** gives you **the perfect ingredients** to create the **best online dating service** or **social networking** website on the World Wide Web!*

## üõ† Installation

  * Git Repository:
    * Clone pH7Builder from Github `git clone git@github.com:pH7Software/pH7-Social-Dating-CMS.git ph7builder`
      (use `--depth=1` flag at the end of the line if you don't need the git history)
    * [Install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
    * From a command line opened in the project folder, run `composer install` to install pH7Builder's dependencies.
  * Composer:
    * [Install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
    * `composer create-project ph7software/ph7builder --prefer-dist ph7builder`
  * Sourceforge:
    * Directly download the latest stable version from [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ph7socialdating/).
  * Softaculous:
    * If your Web host offers Softaculous, you might be able to install [pH7Builder in one-click with Softaculous](https://www.softaculous.com/apps/socialnetworking/pH7Builder).


## üèó Nginx Configuration

In order to get pH7Builder working on nginx server, you need to add some custom nginx configuration.

Create `/etc/nginx/ph7builder.conf` and add the following:

```nginx
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
    index index.php;
}
```

*Please note that the above code is the strict minimum and obviously you can add more rules by comparing with the [main Apache .htaccess file](https://github.com/pH7Software/pH7-Social-Dating-CMS/blob/master/.htaccess).*

Finally, in your nginx server configuration, you will have to include `ph7builder.conf` file to complete the configuration like below:

In file, e.g., *`/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/yoursite.conf`* for Ubuntu and other OS based on Debian or `/etc/nginx/conf.d/yoursite.conf` for CentOS and other OS based on Red Hat.

```nginx
server {
    # Port number. In most cases, 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS
    listen 80;

    server_name www.yoursite.com;
    root /var/www/ph7builder_public_root;
    index index.php;
    client_max_body_size 50M;

    error_log /var/log/nginx/yoursite.error.log;
    access_log /var/log/nginx/yoursite.access.log;

    # Include ph7builder.conf. You can also directly add the "location" rule instead of including the conf file
    include /etc/nginx/ph7builder.conf;
}
```

For more information, please refer to the nginx documentation.
